# A Dish Of Dust
A twitter bot that parodies the combinatorial poetry generator "A House of Dust" by Alison Knowles. 


Original code (only its spirit remains) was taken from Nick Montfort's reimplementation of the original FORTRAN program in python. All of his work can be found at https://nickm.com/memslam/.

Intended to be a comedic bot which just makes up insane foods (which often sound revolting) and assigns them various ethnicities, descriptive qualities, and preparation methods.

### Note: My home server has been down for a couple months so the bot has not been running.
